# Maze Solver Using BFS and DFS

## Description
This project implements a **Maze Solver** using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms.  
Given a 2D maze grid (0 = path, 1 = wall), the program finds a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

## Features
- BFS and DFS implemented from scratch
- Reads maze from text files
- Prints the maze with the solution path marked with `*`
- Easily extendable for GUI or other algorithms

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Maze-Solver.git
cd Maze-Solver
